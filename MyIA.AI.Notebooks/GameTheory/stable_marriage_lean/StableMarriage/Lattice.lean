  Stable Marriage - Lattice Structure on Stable Matchings
  ========================================================

  Knuth (1976) showed that the set of stable matchings forms a lattice
  under the "common preferences" ordering. Wu & Roth (2018) generalized
  this to many-to-one; we specialize to the one-to-one case.

  Key results:
  - Stable matchings are partially ordered by man-preference
  - The join (supremum) of two stable matchings is stable
  - The meet (infimum) of two stable matchings is stable
  - The set of stable matchings forms a distributive lattice
  - The GS man-proposing output is the top (man-optimal) element

  Strategy:
  - We define μ ≤ ν iff every man prefers μ to ν (or is indifferent)
  - join μ ν: each man gets his preferred partner between μ and ν
  - meet μ ν: each man gets his less-preferred partner between μ and ν
  - Wu-Roth Lemma 3.2 (one-to-one): join and meet of stable matchings are stable
  - Stanley lemma: finite join-semilattice with min = lattice

Man-preference ordering on matchings: μ ≤ ν iff every man prefers
his partner in μ at least as much as in ν (i.e., menPref m (μ m) ≤ menPref m (ν m)).
Lower rank = more preferred, so μ ≤ ν means μ is man-preferred over ν.

Anti-crossing: if two stable matchings share a woman w (μ.sp m₁ = w, ν.sp m₂ = w),
then the other partners are also shared: μ.sp m₂ = ν.sp m₁.
This is the core of Knuth's decomposition lemma (1976, Theorem 1.6.3).

Proof structure (3 cases by case-splitting on preferences):

  Case A: m₁ prefers w = μ(m₁) over w₁ = ν(m₁)
    Case A1: m₂ also prefers w over w₂ = μ(m₂)
      → Blocking pair contradiction against μ-stability (PROVED below, L176-L183)
    Case A2: m₂ prefers w₂ over w
      → Dual blocking-pair contradiction (SCAFFOLDED below)

  Case B: m₁ prefers w₁ = ν(m₁) over w = μ(m₁)
    → Symmetric to Case A by exchanging μ ↔ ν, m₁ ↔ m₂ (SCAFFOLDED below)

The proved fragment `no_cross_if_both_choose_cross` covers the cross-case
used by `meetSpouse_injective`.

Historical reference:
  Knuth (1976), "Mariages Stables", Theorem 1.6.3 and pp. 56-57.
  The anti-crossing lemma is the key ingredient for showing the lattice
  structure: it establishes that join and meet preserve bijectivity.

Proof strategy for Case A2 (the hardest sub-case):
  Hypotheses in context:
    - hm₁ : ManPrefers m₁ w w₁        (m₁ prefers his μ-partner over his ν-partner)
    - ¬hm₂ : ¬ManPrefers m₂ w w₂      (m₂ does NOT prefer w over his μ-partner w₂)
    - hwp₁ : ¬WomanPrefers w m₁ m₂    (from ν-stability applied to (m₁, w))
    - hw_m₂_pref : WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁ (derived from hwp₁ + injectivity of womenPref)

  Goal: False (contradiction from m₁ ≠ m₂)

  Step 1: Derive ¬WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁ from μ-stability.
    The key insight: m₂ is matched to w₂ in μ, and w₂ ≠ w.
    From ¬hm₂ we get menPref m₂ w₂ ≤ menPref m₂ w (m₂ weakly prefers w₂).
    Since w₂ ≠ w, we need to show (m₂, w) doesn't block μ.
    ManPrefers m₂ w (μ.spouse m₂) = ManPrefers m₂ w w₂ is FALSE (from ¬hm₂).
    So man-side fails → μ-stability gives no information directly.

    Instead, we use ν-stability on (m₂, w):
    ManPrefers m₂ w (ν.spouse m₂)? ν.spouse m₂ = w (from h2).
    So m₂ is already matched to w in ν → (m₂, w) can't block ν.

    The correct path: use BOTH stabilities on the SAME woman w.
    - ν-stability on (m₁, w): already gave ¬WomanPrefers w m₁ m₂
    - μ-stability on (m₂, w): need ManPrefers m₂ w (μ.spouse m₂) = ManPrefers m₂ w w₂.
      But ¬hm₂ says this is false! So μ-stability doesn't directly help.

    The trick: we DON'T need both non-preferences from stability alone.
    Instead:
    - ¬WomanPrefers w m₁ m₂  (from ν-stab on (m₁, w), already proved as hwp₁)
    - ¬WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁  (need to derive)

    For ¬WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁: suppose WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁.
    Then (m₂, w) blocks ν: ManPrefers m₂ w (ν.spouse m₂) = ManPrefers m₂ w w?
    ν.spouse m₂ = w (from h2), so m₂ is already matched to w in ν.
    This means IsBlockingPair ν m₂ w requires ManPrefers m₂ w w = false.
    So this doesn't work either!

    CORRECT approach (Knuth's original argument):
    Use the WEAK preference ¬hm₂ to get menPref m₂ w₂ ≤ menPref m₂ w.
    Combined with hw_ne_w2 (w₂ ≠ w), this means womenPref w₂ < womenPref w
    is NOT established. Instead:

    The real argument uses ν-stability on (m₂, μ.spouse m₂) = (m₂, w₂):
    - We need ManPrefers m₂ w₂ (ν.spouse m₂) = ManPrefers m₂ w₂ w.
    - ¬hm₂ gives menPref m₂ w₂ ≤ menPref m₂ w, i.e., ¬ManPrefers m₂ w w₂.
    - So ManPrefers m₂ w₂ w iff menPref m₂ w₂ < menPref m₂ w, which is ¬hm₂... NO.
    - ¬hm₂ means menPref m₂ w ≤ menPref m₂ w₂ (m₂ weakly prefers w₂).

    Final approach: combine BOTH ¬WomanPrefers from the SAME pattern as Case A1.
    From ν-stab(m₁,w): hwp₁ = ¬WomanPrefers w m₁ m₂
    From μ-stab(m₁,w): μ.spouse m₁ = w, so (m₁, w) can't block μ (man already matched to w in μ).

    The key: use ν-stability on (m₂, w₂):
    - Need ManPrefers m₂ w₂ (ν.spouse m₂) = ManPrefers m₂ w₂ w.
    - From hw_m₂_pref: WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁, so womenPref w m₂ < womenPref w m₁.
    - We need to show this leads to a contradiction with μ-stability on (m₁, w₂).

    Ultimately the proof reduces to the SAME pattern as no_cross_if_both_choose_cross:
    obtain ¬WomanPrefers w m₁ m₂ and ¬WomanPrefers w m₂ m₁ from dual stability,
    then antisymmetry of womenPref + injectivity gives m₁ = m₂.
    The challenge is constructing the right blocking pair applications.

  SCAFFOLDING: the `have` steps below decompose the proof into bite-sized
  sub-goals that a prover agent can attack independently.

/-! ## Join and Meet Operations -/

/--
The join spouse function: each man gets his preferred partner between μ and ν.
Defined as a bare function so that bijectivity can be proved separately with
stability hypotheses. The join is NOT bijective for arbitrary matchings;
it requires both μ and ν to be stable (anti-complementarity).
-/
noncomputable def Matching.joinSpouse (μ ν : Matching n) (m : Fin n) : Fin n :=
  if prof.menPref m (μ.spouse m) ≤ prof.menPref m (ν.spouse m) then
    μ.spouse m
  else
    ν.spouse m

/--
The meet spouse function: each man gets his less-preferred partner between μ and ν.
-/
noncomputable def Matching.meetSpouse (μ ν : Matching n) (m : Fin n) : Fin n :=
  if prof.menPref m (μ.spouse m) ≤ prof.menPref m (ν.spouse m) then
    ν.spouse m
  else
    μ.spouse m

/--
Injectivity of join: if joinSpouse μ ν m₁ = joinSpouse μ ν m₂, then m₁ = m₂.
Key insight: the cross-cases (one man picks μ-spouse, other picks ν-spouse,
both equal same woman w) lead to a blocking-pair contradiction via stability.
The easy cases (both men pick same matching) follow from that matching's injectivity.

Key lemma for man-optimality: if some man m' prefers his partner in another
stable matching ν over his partner in μ, then there exists a blocking pair
for μ involving m' and ν.spouse m'.

This is the contrapositive of man-optimality: it shows that no man can be
strictly better off in another stable matching.

DEPENDS ON: `no_cross_match` (Case A2/B must be proved first).

Proof strategy:
  Given: ¬(menPref m' (μ.spouse m') ≤ menPref m' (ν.spouse m'))
         i.e., ManPrefers m' (ν.spouse m') (μ.spouse m')
  Want:  ∃ m w, IsBlockingPair prof μ m w

  Let w' = ν.spouse m'. Then m' prefers w' over μ.spouse m'.
  Consider woman w' and her μ-partner m = μ.inverse w'.
  By stability of μ: ¬IsBlockingPair μ m' w'.
  So either ¬ManPrefers m' w' (μ.spouse m') [contradicts hypothesis]
  or     ¬WomanPrefers w' m' (μ.inverse w') = ¬WomanPrefers w' m' m.

  If ¬WomanPrefers w' m' m, then w' prefers m over m'.
  Now consider ν: ν.spouse m' = w', so ν.inverse w' = m'.
  By stability of ν: ¬IsBlockingPair ν m w'.
  ManPrefers m w' (ν.spouse m) needs to be checked.
  If it holds, then ¬WomanPrefers w' m m' → w' prefers m' over m.
  But we just said w' prefers m over m'. Contradiction!

  This gives us a circular contradiction that forces menPref equality.

  This lemma is the "key step" of the Rural Hospital argument.

/--
The man-proposing Gale-Shapley output is the top element of the lattice
of stable matchings under ManLE: every man gets his best achievable partner.
ManLE prof μ_gs μ' means each man's GS partner is at least as preferred
as his partner in any other stable matching μ'.

This is the **Man-Optimality Theorem** (also known as the **Rural Hospital
Theorem** in the many-to-one setting). It states that the GS man-proposing
output simultaneously optimizes every man's outcome.

There are two independent proof strategies:

  **Strategy A (Lattice-theoretic, RECOMMENDED after no_cross_match is proved)**:
    1. no_cross_match → joinSpouse_injective / meetSpouse_injective
    2. → Matching.join and Matching.meet are well-defined bijections
    3. → join_isStable / meet_isStable (ALREADY PROVED below)
    4. → the set of stable matchings forms a lattice under ManLE
    5. → the GS output is the supremum of all stable matchings
       (because each man proposes in decreasing preference order,
        and no man can be rejected by a woman who is achievable in
        some stable matching — the key inductive argument)

    This strategy avoids direct GS algorithm reasoning and instead
    uses the lattice structure as an abstraction layer.

  **Strategy B (Algorithmic, via GS invariants)**:
    1. Define the invariant: "for every man m, if m has proposed to
       woman w in the GS execution, then w is not matched to any man
       m' with menPref m' w < menPref m w in any stable matching"
    2. Prove this invariant is preserved by each GS step
       (using `menProposedDownward`, `womenBestState` from Lemmas.lean)
    3. At termination, no man can be improved upon → μ_gs is optimal

    This requires connecting `GSState` invariants to `IsStable`,
    which currently lacks the transfer lemma.

  Strategy A is shorter and reuses the lattice infrastructure we've built.
  It requires `no_cross_match` (Cases A2/B) to be proved first.

  Strategy B is more general (works for many-to-one) but requires
  new infrastructure (~5-10h of Lean formalization for the transfer lemma).

  --
  -- The goal is: menPref m (μ_gs.spouse m) ≤ menPref m (μ'.spouse m)
  -- i.e., μ_gs gives m a partner at least as good as any other stable matching.
  --
  -- Proof outline:
  --
  -- Step 1: By contradiction. Assume ¬(menPref m (μ_gs.spouse m) ≤ menPref m (μ'.spouse m)).
  --   This means ManPrefers m (μ'.spouse m) (μ_gs.spouse m): m prefers his ν-partner.
  --   by_contra hgt
  --   push_neg at hgt
  --   have hstrict : prof.menPref m (μ'.spouse m) < prof.menPref m (μ_gs.spouse m) := mod_cast hgt
  --
  -- Step 2: Apply man_optimality_key_step.
  --   exact man_optimality_key_step prof μ_gs μ' hgs hstable m hstrict
  --
  -- ALTERNATIVE (direct proof without key_step lemma):
  --
  -- Step 1': by_contra hgt
  -- Step 2': set w_gs := μ_gs.spouse m
  --          set w' := μ'.spouse m
  --          hstrict : menPref m w' < menPref m w_gs (m prefers w' over w_gs)
  --
  -- Step 3': μ_gs-stability on (m, w'):
  --   ManPrefers m w' (μ_gs.spouse m) holds (from hstrict).
  --   So ¬WomanPrefers w' m (μ_gs.inverse w') must hold.
  --   This means womenPref w' (μ_gs.inverse w') ≤ womenPref w' m.
  --
  -- Step 4': Now consider the man m_gs = μ_gs.inverse w'.
  --   μ_gs.spouse m_gs = w'. m_gs ≠ m (since w_gs ≠ w' by injectivity).
  --   In ν: ν.spouse m = w'. In μ_gs: μ_gs.spouse m_gs = w'.
  --   By no_cross_match μ_gs ν' with these hypotheses:
  --     μ_gs.spouse m = ν.spouse m_gs ... but this requires exactly the
  --     anti-crossing lemma we're trying to prove! Circular unless we
  --     use the already-proved Case A1 + cross-fragment.
  --
  -- The circular dependency shows why this theorem is HARD:
  -- it requires either (a) the full no_cross_match, or (b) a direct
  -- GS algorithm argument. Both are substantial.
