  vihdzp/combinatorial-games Reference Project
  =============================================

  This project references vihdzp/combinatorial-games as a Lake dependency
  to explore and present their formalized combinatorial game theory results:

  - Surreal numbers (field structure, dyadic representation, Hahn series)
  - Nimbers (algebraically closed field of characteristic 2)
  - General combinatorial games (birthday, canonical form, impartial games)
  - Sign expansions and ordinal representations

  This is the upstream repository that superseded Mathlib's CGT modules,
  removed in PR #35550 (Feb 2026) after 6 months of deprecation (PR #28063).
