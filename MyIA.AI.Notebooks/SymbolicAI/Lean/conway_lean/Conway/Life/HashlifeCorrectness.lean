## Phase 3b — Bounded correctness theorem for Hashlife

This module is **scaffolding for multi-agent prover iteration** (Epic #1453
harness co-evolution). Every theorem is stated precisely with `sorry`
placeholders. Each `sorry` is a self-contained prover target, ranked by
mathematical difficulty (P1 = easiest, P5 = hardest).

## Goal

The central theorem:

    theorem hashlife_correct (n : Nat) (g : Grid) (h : box_assez_grand g n) :
        evolveHashlifeFast n g = evolve n g

It says: given enough padding around `g`, the exponential-speedup Hashlife
implementation (`evolveHashlifeFast`) agrees with the reference step-by-step
implementation (`evolve`) after `n` generations.

## Proof strategy (5 lemmas)

The proof decomposes into 5 sub-goals. Each is a standalone `sorry` below.

  **P1. box_assez_grand_predicate** (trivial)
     Define the padding predicate. Pure definition, no proof.

  **P2. step_light_cone** (locality — the cone of dependence)
     After `t` generations, the state of cell `(r, c)` depends only on the
     initial state of cells within Manhattan distance `t`. This is B3/S23's
     "speed of light = 1 cell/generation".

  **P3. padCenter2_frame_lemma** (frame correctness)
     `padCenter2 c` correctly places `c` at the center of a level-`(k+2)`
     MacroCell, with `2^k` dead padding on each side.

  **P4. hashlifeResult_central_correct** (decompose-compose)
     On a level-`k` MacroCell `c` with adequate padding, `hashlifeResult c`
     equals `step^[2^(k-2)]` applied to the centered sub-region.

  **P5. hashlife_correct** (composition)
     Compose P2-P4 by induction on `n` to get the final theorem.

## Prover iteration protocol

Each `sorry` here is a target for `MyIA.AI.Notebooks/SymbolicAI/Lean/agent_tests/prover/`.
The prover runs `lake build Conway.Life.HashlifeCorrectness` after each patch
and uses the `sorry_delta` as the forensic signal. As each `sorry` is
eliminated, the corresponding lemma is moved out of "scaffolding" status.

The difficulty rating drives agent selection:
  - P1/P2 (simple): local Qwen tactic agent
  - P3 (structural): z.ai GLM coordinator + tactic agent
  - P4 (compositional): OpenRouter frontier (Opus/GPT-5) Director escalation
  - P5 (induction): OpenRouter frontier with `--director-provider openrouter`

See `agent_tests/prover/RUNBOOK.md` for iteration protocol.

## Non-goals (out of scope for this module)

- Memoization / hash-consing (algorithmic performance, not correctness).
- Unbounded `hashlife_correct` without `box_assez_grand` hypothesis.
- Periodicity arguments for OTCA/Gemini (Phase 6-7).

/-! ## P1. Padding predicate

The predicate `box_assez_grand : Grid → Nat → Bool` asserts that every live
cell has at least `n` cells of margin to the MacroCell domain boundary on all
four sides. This is the genuine light-cone "boundary doesn't leak" hypothesis
(strengthened c.151, replacing the vacuous always-true version of c.148). -/

/-- Per-cell light-cone margin check (Bool): the cell `(r,c)` has margin ≥ `n`
    on all four sides of the MacroCell domain `[r0, r0+sz) × [c0, c0+sz)`:
    top `r0+n ≤ r`, bottom `r < r0+sz-n`, left `c0+n ≤ c`, right `c < c0+sz-n`.

    Isolated as a helper taking `r0 c0 sz` as **parameters** (not read from
    `gridFrame`) so that `cellMargin_true_iff` proves cleanly with free
    variables — `decide_eq_true_eq` fires on `decide (r0+n ≤ r)` when `r0` is a
    bound variable, but gets stuck in the `Int.decLe` match when `r0` is the
    non-reducible projection `(gridFrame g).1.1`. This split keeps `mono_n`
    tractable (it bridges through `cellMargin_true_iff`, never unfolding the
    decidability of a symbolic `gridFrame`). -/
def cellMargin (r0 c0 sz : Int) (n : Nat) (r c : Int) : Bool :=
  decide (r0 + n ≤ r) && decide (r < r0 + sz - n) &&
  decide (c0 + n ≤ c) && decide (c < c0 + sz - n)

/-- The "box assez grand" predicate (light-cone margin, strengthened c.151):
    every live cell of `g` has at least `n` cells of margin to the MacroCell
    domain boundary on all four sides.

    This ensures that over `n` generations, no live cell — and nothing in its
    `n`-step light cone — can reach the MacroCell boundary. The Game of Life
    light cone has radius `n`: each generation, a cell's influence spreads by
    one in Manhattan distance, so over `n` generations a cell can move at most
    `n` towards the boundary. Requiring margin `≥ n` on every side is exactly
    the "boundary doesn't leak" hypothesis the docstring (P1) advertises.

    **Strengthened per ai-01 design-gate decision (a)** (c.148 → c.151): the
    previous definition computed a *fictional* level `k := max 2 (natCeilLog2
    (side + 2*n))` and checked `2^k ≥ target && k ≥ 2`, which is *vacuously
    always-true* (it can always find such a `k`) — see the now-superseded
    `box_assez_grand_always_true` diagnostic. This version instead reads the
    *actual* level `lvl` chosen by `gridFrame g` and checks the genuine
    geometric margin from each live cell to the domain `[r0, r0+2^lvl)²`. It
    is therefore **non-vacuous**: it fails for tight grids / large `n` (see
    `box_assez_grand_not_vacuous`). The `BoxAssezGrand g n` hypothesis in the
    P5 theorems now carries genuine information (ai-01: "equivalence
    conditionnelle"). -/

/-! ### n-aware margin predicate (`box_assez_grandN`) — P5 redesign gate N1

The n-aware dual of `box_assez_grand` over `gridFrameN n g` (padding `max 2 n`,
see `MacroCell.gridFrameN`). Unlike the fixed-`gridFrame` version — which is
unsatisfiable for `n > 2` (`boxAssezGrand_nonempty_le_two`) — this predicate is
satisfiable for `n` arbitrarily large, because the `max 2 n` padding guarantees
each live cell `max 2 n ≥ n` cells of margin by construction. The witnesses
below exhibit `n = 3 > 2` for the single-cell grid: `box_assez_grandN` holds
where `box_assez_grand` provably fails — the concrete dual of the unsat cap
that `gridFrameN` breaks (issue #3846). -/

    `n = 3 > 2` on the single-cell grid. With `gridFrameN 3 [(0,0)]` the
    padding is `max 2 3 = 3`, giving margin `3 ≥ 3` on every side, so the
    large-`n` light-cone hypothesis holds where the fixed-2 `gridFrame` could
    not (issue #3846, gate N1). -/

/-- **Universal large-`n` non-vacuity (gate W1, issue #3846)**: the n-aware
    predicate `box_assez_grandN` holds for the single-cell grid at *every* `n`.
    This is the constructive dual of the `boxAssezGrand_nonempty_le_two` unsat
    cap: the fixed frame forces `n ≤ 2`, the n-aware frame `gridFrameN` admits
    every `n` because it pads by `max 2 n ≥ n` on all sides. The single-cell
    extremes are all `0`, so the frame offset is `-(max 2 n)`; after unfolding,
    the four `cellMargin` bounds reduce to `n ≤ max 2 n` (top/left, free from
    `le_max_right`) and `max 2 n + n < 2^lvl` (bottom/right), where
    `2^lvl ≥ 1 + 2·(max 2 n) ≥ (max 2 n) + n + 1` by `ceilLog2_spec`. The
    `Int`/`Nat`-cast between the goal's `(2 : Int) ^ lvl` and the `Nat` spec is
    bridged by `exact_mod_cast`. -/

/-! ### Monotonicity of `box_assez_grand` in the padding parameter

A grid that admits `n` cells of margin also admits any smaller amount `m ≤ n`:
the MacroCell level `lvl` is unchanged (same grid `g`), and each live cell's
four margin bounds only become *weaker* when `n` shrinks (`r0 + m ≤ r0 + n ≤ r`,
and `r < r0 + sz - n ≤ r0 + sz - m`). This is **pure linear arithmetic**
in `n` once `lvl`, `r0`, `c0`, `sz` are fixed. -/

    theorems carries genuine information (ai-01: "equivalence conditionnelle").

    A single live cell at `(0,0)` lives in the level-`3` MacroCell frame
    `[-2, 6) × [-2, 6)` (`gridFrame` gives side `5`, `ceilLog2 5 = 3`,

    `n = 2` but fails for `n = 3` (`-2 + 3 = 1 ≰ 0`). This supersedes the c.148
    `box_assez_grand_always_true` diagnostic (removed): the vacuous-always-true

/-! ### Structural satisfiability bound (N1 audit, 2026-07-09)

The sanity witnesses below (`BoxAssezGrand block 2`, glider, blinker, …)
observe that the strengthened predicate only holds for `n ≤ 2` on the
canonical patterns. The lemmas of this section prove that this bound is
**structural in `gridFrame`, not pattern-specific**: for *every* non-empty
grid, `gridFrame` anchors the domain at `r0 := rMin - 2` (fixed 2-cell
padding), so the topmost live cell has top margin exactly `2`, and
`cellMargin` demands `r0 + n ≤ r` — hence `BoxAssezGrand g n → n ≤ 2`.

Meanwhile `gridFrame` picks `side ≥ 5` (1-cell bounding box + 4 padding), so
the MacroCell level is ≥ 3 and `jumpSize = 2^lvl ≥ 8`. Consequences for the
P5.2 plan (see the obstacle scan before `p5_large_n_jump`):

- the hypotheses of `p5_large_n_jump` (`BoxAssezGrand g n` **and**
  `n ≥ jumpSize …`) are **jointly unsatisfiable on non-empty grids**
  (`p5_large_n_hyps_unsat` below) — the large-`n` arm of `p5_inductive_step`
  is reachable only for `g = []`;
- the sketched N1 frame lemma ("the jump preserves `BoxAssezGrand` through
  the recursion") is **vacuous as stated** — same trap as the deleted
  `p4_half_steps_compose` placeholder (N2-bis, G.2 gaming);
- a `padGrid`-style helper adding live sentinel cells (the N5 sketch) cannot
  fix satisfiability: whichever cell ends up topmost after padding *still*
  has top margin exactly `2` by construction of `gridFrame`. The honest
  unlock is a `gridFrame`/`box_assez_grand` redesign (e.g. padding parameter
  dependent on `n`) — design gate, ai-01.

These lemmas are *diagnostic*: like `box_assez_grand_not_vacuous` (c.148),
they document a geometric property of the current definitions so the P5 plan
can be re-scoped honestly instead of closed vacuously. -/

/-- **Structural cap on the padding parameter**: for any non-empty grid,
    `BoxAssezGrand g n` forces `n ≤ 2`. The topmost live cell (witnessed by
    `gridRowMin_mem`) has top margin exactly `2` in the frame chosen by
    `gridFrame` (`r0 = rMin - 2`), and `cellMargin` requires `r0 + n ≤ r`. -/

/-! ## P0. Light-cone warm-up lemmas (prover ramp)

Elementary facts about `manhattan` and `lightCone` that feed the **base case**
of P2 (`step_light_cone` at `t = 0`). `manhattan_self` and `manhattan_comm` are
hand-proved here (genuine content — `manhattan` is a metric-like quantity, these
are the reflexivity and symmetry axioms). `self_mem_lightCone` and
`lightCone_zero` are **proved** (PRs #2097, #2107). Originally left as `sorry`
for multi-agent prover warm-up (Epic #1453), both were eliminated by hand
proofs during the prover iteration cycle. -/

/-- Every cell lies in its own light cone, for any radius `t`.

    **Proof strategy** (P0, difficulty: easy):
    `manhattan p p = 0 ≤ t` (by `manhattan_self`), so `p` passes the `d ≤ t`
    filter. Unfold `lightCone`; the `i = t` term of `rs` gives
    `p.1 - t + t = p.1` and the `j = t` term of `cs` gives `p.2`, so the pair
    `(p.1, p.2) = p` is produced. Discharge membership over
    `List.flatMap`/`List.filterMap` with `List.mem_flatMap` /
    `List.mem_filterMap`. -/

/-- The light cone of radius `0` is exactly the singleton `[p]`.

    **Proof strategy** (P0, difficulty: easy):

    filter keeps `(p.1, p.2)` since `d = 0 ≤ 0`. The whole expression reduces by
    computation — `simp [lightCone]` followed by `decide`, or a direct `List`
    evaluation after `Prod.ext`. -/

/-! ## P2. Light-cone locality (speed of light = 2 in Manhattan distance)

The state of cell `p` after `t` generations of B3/S23 depends only on the
initial state of cells within Manhattan distance `2*t` of `p`. This is the
"speed of light" principle for GoL: in one step, information can travel to
any Moore neighbor (Chebyshev distance 1, Manhattan distance ≤ 2). After
`t` steps, the reachable region has Chebyshev radius `t`, which is contained
in the Manhattan ball of radius `2*t`.

### Helper lemmas for P2

These bridge lemmas establish the locality of a single B3/S23 step, which
is then lifted by induction to `evolve t`. -/

/-- If `manhattan p q ≤ t`, then `q ∈ lightCone p t`.

    Left as sorry — the proof requires constructing explicit list membership
    witnesses in the `lightCone` comprehension, with `Int.toNat` conversion
    and `Int.natAbs` symmetry. The mathematical fact is trivially true:
    if `|q.1 - p.1| + |q.2 - p.2| ≤ t` then `(q.1, q.2)` is within the
    Manhattan ball of radius `t`, which is exactly what `lightCone p t` enumerates. -/

of `evolve u g₁` and `evolve u g₂` on `lightCone p (2*t)` to agreement of

/-! ## P2 corollary. Influence cone (light cone of influence)

`step_light_cone` is the **cone of dependence**: to know the state of `p`
after `t` generations, it suffices to know the cells of `g` within Manhattan
distance `2*t` of `p`. Its contrapositive is the **cone of influence**: a live
cell of `g` outside Manhattan distance `2*t` of `p` cannot make `p` live at
generation `t`. Equivalently, if `p` is live after `t` generations, some live
cell of `g` must lie within Manhattan distance `2*t` — the live region can
expand toward the MacroCell boundary by at most `2*t` per `t` generations.

This is the sorry-free, P4-independent geometric fact underpinning the
`BoxAssezGrand`-preservation argument for P5.2 (the recursion's padding
hypothesis is preserved because the jump of `jumpSize` generations expands the
live region by at most `2*jumpSize`, within the margin `n`). -/

    agrees with the empty grid on the cone, so `step_light_cone` equates
    `evolve t g` to `evolve t ∅` (which is dead everywhere) at `p`.

    This is the directly-usable form for the `BoxAssezGrand`-preservation
    argument: outside the live region (margin ≥ `n`), the cone is all-dead, so
    `evolve t` cannot bring a boundary cell to life within `t < n/2` generations. -/

/-! ## P3. Padding correctness

`padCenter2 c` places `c` (assuming `c.level ≥ 1`) inside a level-`(k+2)`
MacroCell. Each application of `padToLevelPlus1` shifts every cell of
the original input by `+2^(k-1)` (the input lands in the SE position of
the SW sub-quadrant for `nw`, NE/SW/SE wrap analogously). Composing twice,
`padCenter2` shifts every cell of `c` by `+2^(k-1) + 2^k = 3·2^(k-1)`.

To recover `c.toCellsAux 0 0` from `(padCenter2 c).toCellsAux _ _`,
the calling offset must therefore be `-3·2^(k-1)` on both axes. -/

/-- (helper) Empty `MacroCell`s contribute no live cells to the enumeration.

/-- The cells of `padCenter2 c` viewed from the corrected center offset
    equal the cells of `c` viewed from origin. The negative offset
    `-(3·2^(k-1))` exactly cancels the cumulative shift introduced by

    **Statement correction (#2197)**: the previous version used
    `center_off = (2^k, 2^k)`, which is incorrect — it would only cancel
    a shift of `-2^k`, but the actual shift introduced by `padCenter2`

    (leaves have level 0). For the node case, apply `padToLevelPlus1_toCellsAux_node`
    twice (the level after one application becomes `1 + nw.level + 1`, so the second

/-! ### N2 step 3 bridge: `padCenter2` margin ≥ Chebyshev jump reach

The geometric precondition for `p5_large_n_jump`: the `padCenter2`
margin `(3·2^(k-1))` strictly contains the Hashlife jump reach
(`2^k`) for any level-`k ≥ 1` MacroCell. Proving this eliminates the
last geometric question before `p5_large_n_jump` can be assembled:

    a level-`k` MacroCell has side `2^k`; padded by 2 levels it has
    side `2^(k+2) = 4·2^k`; the per-side margin is `(4·2^k - 2^k)/2
    = 3·2^(k-1)`. The Hashlife jump size is `jumpSize k = 2^k`, and
    by `evolve_reach_chebyshev` (lightCone.lean L270-298, N2 step 2),
    any cell alive after `2^k` generations lies within Chebyshev
    distance `2^k` of an initial cell. Since `2^k ≤ 3·2^(k-1)` for
    `k ≥ 1`, the Chebyshev reach fits inside the margin with a factor
    of 3/2 to spare.

This is the **pure-arithmetic half** of the light-cone ↔ padding
bridge. It is independently provable (no coordinate hypotheses, no
`MacroCell` arguments), so it can be wired into `p5_large_n_jump`
once the P4 inductive step (`p4_succ_membership`) closes.

Sorry-free, additive, no existing sorries modified (§D anti-regression
safe). EPIC #3846 (N2 step 3, research-Long dedicated session). -/

/-- **Pad-margin ≥ jump-reach** (pure arithmetic, sorry-free).
    For a level-`k ≥ 1` MacroCell, the per-side `padCenter2` margin
    `3·2^(k-1)` is strictly larger than the Hashlife jump size `2^k`
    — i.e. the margin contains the Chebyshev reach of the jump.
    Equivalently, the side length `4·2^k` of the padded cell exceeds
    the jump reach `2·2^k` (Chebyshev radius `2^k` doubled) by a
    factor of 2.

    Proof: distribute `3 = 1 + 2`, reduce goal to
    `2^k ≤ 2^(k-1) + 2·2^(k-1)`, then rewrite
    `2·2^(k-1) = 2^((k-1)+1) = 2^k` via `pow_succ'` and the
    `(k-1)+1 = k` linear fact (the only piece `omega` closes here;
    the actual power rewrite is not linear, hence explicit). Finally
    `Nat.add_comm` puts the goal in the form `2^k ≤ 2^k + 2^(k-1)`,
    closed by `Nat.le_add_right`. -/

/-! ## Well-formedness of MacroCells

`MacroCell.level` only walks the `nw` spine, so `c.level = k + 2` does
**not** constrain the `ne`/`sw`/`se` subtrees. `hashlifeResultAux` sends
such malformed cells to its defensive arm (`emptyOfLevel (c.level - 1)`),
while `toGrid`/`evolve` still see the live cells of the misplaced
subtrees — so the unrestricted P4 statement is **false**
(`p4_unrestricted_counterexample` below).

`wf` formalizes the convention stated on the `MacroCell` type ("all
required, by convention but not enforced by the type, to have the same
level"). It is the missing hypothesis of P4. Candidate for promotion to
`Conway.Life.MacroCell` once the P4/P5 proofs land. -/

/-! ## P4. Hashlife central result (decompose-compose)

On a level-`k` MacroCell `c` with adequate padding, `hashlifeResult c`
equals `step^[2^(k-2)]` applied to the centered sub-region.

This is the heart of Hashlife: the recursive quadtree decomposition followed
by memoized recomposition gives the same answer as the flat iteration.

**Statement correction (#2215 followup)**: the previous version used `off =
(0, 0)` for both input and output. This is incorrect: `hashlifeResultAux
(k+2) c` produces a level-`(k+1)` cell representing the centered `2^(k+1) ×
2^(k+1)` region of the level-`(k+2)` input. The center starts at position
`(2^k, 2^k)` in the input's coordinate system. So `result.toGrid (2^k,
2^k)` covers `[2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1)) × [2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1))`, which is
exactly the centered region.

**Statement correction (2026-06-11)**: added the `c.wf = true` hypothesis.
Without it the statement is **false**: `c.level = k + 2` only constrains
the `nw` spine, and on malformed cells `hashlifeResultAux` answers
`emptyOfLevel (c.level - 1)` while `evolve` still sees the misplaced live
cells. Certified counterexample: `p4_unrestricted_counterexample`. The
corrected statement is proven in the base case `k = 0` for **all**
well-formed cells (`hashlifeResult_central_correct_base`, 2^16 instances)
and witnessed in the recursive arms at `k = 1` and `k = 2`. -/

/-! ## Canonical-form bridge: P4 list equality ⇔ pointwise membership

Both sides of the P4 statement are **canonical** grids
(`Conway.Life.GridCanonical`): the LHS is a `toGrid` (a `sortDedup` image),
the RHS a `filter` of `evolve (2^k)` with `2^k ≥ 1` (a `step` image). By
rigidity of canonical grids (`Canonical.ext`), proving the list equality is
equivalent to proving membership pointwise — which is where the light-cone
(P2) and double-nine decomposition arguments actually live. -/

    Membership of `p` in `c.toGrid (r0, c0)` is equivalent to membership of the

    content is the same grid, just viewed at a different origin. This is the
    shift ingredient the P4.4 offset-matching assembly needs to relate each
    quadrant membership `p ∈ out_*.toGrid (off, off)` (after `mem_toGrid_node`
    decomposes the result node into its four children at offsets `(2^k, 2^k)`,
    `(2^k, 2^k + 2^out_nw.level)`, …) to the centered form that

    i.e. re-anchoring the same cell's grid at a different origin.

    This is the double-shift ingredient the P4.4 offset-matching assembly needs:
    after `mem_toGrid_node` decomposes the result node, each quadrant sits at its
    own offset (e.g. NW at `(2^k, 2^k)`), but `centralCorrect_mem` (G2)
    characterizes the quadrant at offset `(2^(k-1), 2^(k-1))` (its `2^j` centering
    with `j = k-1`). `toGrid_shift_between` bridges those two offsets directly,
    without re-centering through `(0,0)` twice. -/

    `hashlifeResultAux`'s definition uses a pattern alias `c@(node ...)`, whose
    alias fvar blocks `simp`/`unfold` syntactic rewriting (cf. the
    `HashlifeMemo` comment). This lemma restates the well-formed arm with
    explicit patterns and zeta-expanded `let`s, so it IS available for
    rewriting from this module. It is true by `rfl` (iota + zeta reduction).

    **Why this is the LHS-unlock for `p4_succ_membership`**: the goal's LHS is
    `p ∈ (hashlifeResultAux (k+2) c).toGrid (2^k, 2^k)`. With `k+2 = (k+1)+1`
    and `c` destructured via `p4_double_nine_shape`, this lemma rewrites the
    `hRA` application to the explicit `node out_nw out_ne out_sw out_se` (else
    branch, level ≥ 3), exposing the `node _ _ _ _` constructor that

`step4x4` is the Hashlife base case (level-2 input -> one generation). It
always returns a level-1 cell, unconditionally: in the `level == 2` arm it
returns `node (leaf _) (leaf _) (leaf _) (leaf _)`, and in the `else` arm it
returns `emptyOfLevel 1`. This level-1 shape is a structural input to the
`hashlifeResult` level-preservation invariant (the level-2 base of
`level_hashlifeResult_of_level_two`). The well-formedness is unconditional
too: four equal-level (level-0) leaves form a wf node, and `emptyOfLevel 1` is
wf (a node of four level-0 empty leaves). -/

`hashlifeResult` on a well-formed level-`k` cell is documented to return a
level-`(k-1)` cell (the centered `2^(k-1) × 2^(k-1)` region after `2^(k-2)`
generations). This level shape is a structural input to the P4
central-correctness assembly: both `result.toGrid (2^k, 2^k)` and the
`restrictGridTo` window presuppose the result is level-`(k+1)` (in the
level-`(k+2)` input's coordinates). The general statement
`(hashlifeResult c).level = c.level - 1` requires a strong-induction on the
double-nine recursion; the level-2 base case below is closed directly by
shape reduction to 16 leaves + definitional evaluation of `hashlifeResultAux`
(the `level == 2` arm yields `step4x4`, a `node` of four leaves → level 1). -/

/-! ## P4 inductive step — scaffolding for the double-nine decomposition

The sorry at `p4_ext_bridge c (k+1) (fun p => by sorry)` is the **research-level
verrou** of the whole module. It demands the pointwise membership biconditional:

    ∀ p, p ∈ (hashlifeResultAux (k+2) c).toGrid (2^k, 2^k)
         ↔ p ∈ restrictGridTo (evolve (2^k) (c.toGrid (0,0))) (2^k) (2^(k+1))

`p4_ext_bridge` (proven) reduces list-equality to this biconditional, so once
the biconditional is discharged, `hashlifeResult_central_correct` closes by
induction. The function `p4_succ_membership` below is the **single named
entry point** that gathers the four sub-lemmas; each sub-lemma is an
independent, difficulty-ranked prover target (grignotable one-per-session).

### Proof plan (the double-nine, two half-steps)

`hashlifeResultAux (k+3) c` on a well-formed level-`(k+2)` cell `c` unfolds
(via the structural-recursion pattern at `Hashlife.lean`) to:

  **Wave 1** — nine overlapping level-`(k+1)` sub-cells `n1..n9`, each recursed
  to a level-`k` result `r1..r9` that is `2^(k-1)` generations ahead (by IH).
  **Wave 2** — four overlapping level-`(k+1)` super-cells `q_nw..q_se` (built
  from the `r_i`), each recursed to a level-`k` result `out_*` that is another
  `2^(k-1)` generations ahead. The two half-steps compose to `2^k` generations,
  matching `evolve (2^k)` — this is the light-cone argument (P2) applied twice.

### Sub-lemmas (difficulty-ranked, each `grignotable` independently)

| Lemma | Difficulty | What it proves |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `p4_double_nine_shape`     | P4.1 (structural) | The 9 sub-cells `n_i` tile `c` and each has level `k+1` + is wf |
| `p4_wave1_ih`              | P4.2 (IH application) | Each `r_i = hashlifeResultAux (k+1) n_i` matches `evolve 2^(k-1)` on the `n_i` window (by IH at level `k`) |
| `p4_wave2_ih`              | P4.3 (IH application) | Each `out_* = hashlifeResultAux (k+1) q_*` matches `evolve 2^(k-1)` on the `q_*` window (by IH at level `k`) |
| ~~`p4_half_steps_compose`~~ | P4.4 (compositional) — **SUBSUMED** | The pure `evolve` half-step composition is `evolve_add` (L2353) + `evolve_half_step` (L2370), both proven sorry-free; the wave-assembly obligation is carried by the residual `sorry` of `p4_succ_membership`. The standalone `: True` placeholder theorem was deleted (N2-bis) as a vacuous dup of an already-closed obligation |

Once all four are proven, `p4_succ_membership` glues them. The ordering
P4.1 → P4.2 → P4.3 → P4.4 reflects dependency: P4.2/P4.3 need P4.1's shape
facts, P4.4 needs P4.2/P4.3. Each is **self-contained**: a session can
eliminate one without re-deriving the others.

See `agent_tests/prover/RUNBOOK.md` for the iteration protocol. -/

/-- **P4.1** (structural half, PROVEN): a well-formed level-`(k+2)` MacroCell
    decomposes into sixteen depth-2 grandchildren `nw_nw..se_se`, each of level
    `k` and well-formed. This is exactly the shape precondition
    `hashlifeResultAux`'s double-nine pattern match relies on: the nine sub-cells
    `n1..n9` of `Hashlife.lean` are each `node`s of four such grandchildren, so
    combined with `node_wf_level_of_four` this discharges every `n_i`'s
    `level = k + 1 ∧ wf = true`.

    The signature `(c : MacroCell)` is preserved so the `p4_succ_membership`
    glue (L1490) typechecks unchanged; the conclusion is the depth-2 existential
    decomposition plus the sixteen `level = k ∧ wf = true` facts, which is
    precisely `wf_node_depth2_grandchildren`'s output. The **geometric half**
    of P4.1 — that the `n_i` union tiles `c`'s live region (a statement on
    `toGrid`/`restrictGridTo` overlap, not just shape) — is genuinely
    non-structural and stays open (research-level, queueable behind the
    `step_light_cone` P2 machinery). -/

/-- **(c.142) Level + well-formedness preservation of `hashlifeResultAux`**,
    over the OPAQUE `cellWf` predicate. For `2 ≤ L` and a well-formed level-`L`
    cell, `hashlifeResultAux L c` is well-formed and level `L - 1`.

    This is the gate for P4.3 (and the wave-2 layer of the lane): wave-2
    super-cells `q_*` are built from `hashlifeResultAux` RESULTS `r_i`, so
    instantiating the central-correctness IH on `q_*` requires `r_i`'s level
    and well-formedness — which only this lemma provides. c.140 proved the
    transparent `.wf` version diverges on whnf (8M heartbeats); the opaque
    `cellWf` conclusion breaks that defeq divergence. -/

/-- The central-correctness statement, abstracted as a named predicate.
    Quoting it as `centralCorrect c j` (instead of the unfolded `2^j`-indexed
    Grid equality) stops the elaborator from running `whnf` on
    `hashlifeResultAux (j+2) c.toGrid` while checking the `ih` argument type of
    `p4_wave1_ih`; that reduction diverges (it pattern-matches `c`, a free
    variable). Unlike the c.138 `@[irreducible]` variant, a plain `def` still
    allows defeq at the `hashlifeResult_central_correct` -> `p4_succ_membership`
    threading boundary (c.139). -/

  (hashlifeResultAux (j + 2) c).toGrid ((2^j : Nat), (2^j : Nat)) =
    restrictGridTo (evolve (2^j) (c.toGrid (0, 0))) (2^j : Int) (2^(j+1))

/-- **The whnf-wall bypass (4th abstraction technique, c.153).**

    `centralCorrect c j` is a *grid equality*. To reason about pointwise
    membership `p ∈ (hashlifeResultAux (j+2) c).toGrid off` WITHOUT whnf-reducing
    the `hashlifeResultAux` term (the wall that blocked c.138–c.140), apply
    `p ∈ ·` to both sides of the equality by **congruence** (`congrArg`), then
    `Iff.of_eq`. This substitutes the `hashlifeResultAux` term *syntactically* —
    it is never unfolded. The four previous techniques (opaque-binder helper
    c.139, `inductive cellWf` c.142, plain `def centralCorrect` c.139,
    `set m := k-1` c.147) all work *around* the wall by hiding hRA behind an
    opaque binder; this one crosses it by congruence, which is exactly what
    G2/G3 need (they must inspect the *membership* of the composed result, not
    just its level/wf).

    Instantiated with `mem_restrictGridTo`, this is the **G1 reduction**
    (membership of a sub-cell whose `centralCorrect` is known, e.g. `q_j` via
    `ih`) in one sorry-free step. The residual wall is **G3 assembly** (how
    `(hashlifeResultAux (k+2) c).toGrid off` decomposes into the four
    `(hashlifeResultAux (k+1) q_j).toGrid off_j` — the `toCellsAux` walk on an
    `hRA` that unfolds), which remains to be bridged. This lemma is the
    `p4_succ_membership` analogue of the P4.3 gate lemma (`hashlifeResultAux_
    level_cellWf`, c.142): sorry-stable infrastructure that unlocks the next
    attack. -/

/-- **Offset-generalized centralCorrect membership** (P4.4 offset-matching G2 gate).

    `centralCorrect_mem` characterizes membership of a cell's result at its
    *canonical* centered offset `(2^j, 2^j)`. The P4.4 offset-matching assembly
    needs the same characterization at the **quadrant offsets** where the
    super-cells `q_*` actually sit in the parent result node (e.g. NW quadrant at
    `(2^k, 2^k)`, per `mem_toGrid_node`). This lemma re-anchors
    `centralCorrect_mem` from `(2^j, 2^j)` to an arbitrary offset `(a, b)` via
    `toGrid_shift_between`: the alive-status is evaluated at the back-shifted
    point `(p.1 - a + 2^j, p.2 - b + 2^j)`, and the centered window bounds
    `[2^j, 2^j + 2^(j+1))` translate to `[a, a + 2^(j+1))` (and `[b, b + 2^(j+1))`).

    Pure composition of `centralCorrect_mem` (G2 congruence, c.153) and
    `toGrid_shift_between` (#4797, the double-shift ingredient) — sorry-free gate
    ingredient. The residual research heart (sorry 4→3) is `evolve_half_step`,
    which consumes this gate to connect the induction hypothesis
    `centralCorrect q_* (k-1)` to the four quadrant offsets at once. -/

/-! ### P4.4 decomposition — balisage en sous-sorries

The research-level composition `evolve (2^k) = evolve (2^(k-1)) ∘ evolve (2^(k-1))`
on the centered window is decomposed into four named sub-goals, each
independently attackable. This turns the monolithic P4.4 `sorry` into a chain
of milestones with clear interfaces (the same methodology that isolated
`hashlifeResultAux_level_cellWf` as a sub-goal unblocked P4.3, c.142).

- **S1 (CLOSED — `evolve_add` below)** : function-iteration composition.
  `evolve (a + b) g = evolve a (evolve b g)`. Pure `step^[·]` arithmetic, no
  `hashlifeResultAux`, no whnf wall — proven.
- **S2 (CLOSED — `window_cone_in_domain` below)** : boundary does not leak —
  for `p` in the centered window `[2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1))²`, the light cone
  `lightCone p (2^k)` (radius of `evolve 2^(k-1)`, via `step_light_cone`) stays
  inside the domain covered by `c.toGrid (0,0)`. Pure Manhattan arithmetic, no
  `hashlifeResultAux`, no whnf wall — proven (`manhattan_deviation` Nat→Int
  bridge + power-normalization + pure-Int `linarith`).
- **S3 (sub-sorry)** : sub-cell coverage — the quadrant super-cell `q_j` whose
  centered region contains `p` agrees with `c.toGrid` on that light cone, so
  `evolve 2^(k-1) (c.toGrid) p = evolve 2^(k-1) (q_j.toGrid) p` by
  `step_light_cone (2^(k-1))`.
- **S4 (sub-sorry, core)** : assemble — combine S1+S2+S3 with the four
  `centralCorrect q_j (k-1)` facts from P4.3 (`p4_wave2_ih`) to conclude the
  pointwise membership agreement that `p4_succ_membership` needs.

S1 (composition) and S2 (no-leak) are closed; the remaining open surface is
the sub-cell-coverage + assembly argument (S3, S4), carried by the residual
`sorry` of `p4_succ_membership`. The standalone `p4_half_steps_compose`
theorem (former `: True` placeholder) was deleted in N2-bis: its pure-evolve
content is exactly `evolve_add` + `evolve_half_step` (both proven), and its
wave-assembly content is exactly the S3/S4 residual, so it duplicated an
already-closed obligation — a vacuous placeholder (G.2). -/

/-- **S1** (CLOSED): `evolve (a + b) g = evolve a (evolve b g)`.

Pure function-iteration arithmetic — `evolve n g = step^[n] g`, so iteration
splits additively. The first closed milestone of the P4.4 balisage: the
composition `evolve 2^k = evolve 2^(k-1) ∘ evolve 2^(k-1)` is exactly
`evolve_add (2^(k-1)) (2^(k-1)) g`. -/

    rw [Nat.succ_add, evolve_succ, evolve_succ, ih]

/-- **S1 2^k instantiation** (CLOSED): `evolve 2^k = evolve 2^(k-1) ∘ evolve 2^(k-1)`.

The exact `2^k`-form of `evolve_add` (S1) that the glue `p4_succ_membership`
and the eventual P4.4 assemble step (S4) consume: the centered-window result of
`evolve 2^k` decomposes into two `evolve 2^(k-1)` half-steps (wave 1 then wave
2). Gated on `1 ≤ k` so that the predecessor `k-1` is well-defined as a `Nat`.
The power fact `2^k = 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)` is discharged in pure `Nat`
(`Nat.pow_succ` + `ring`); `omega` is avoided on the powers because it loses the
positivity of the `2^(k-1)` atom under the additive doubling (cf. the c.146
omega-limitation lesson on `window_cone_in_domain`). -/

  -- `2^(1+(k-1)-1)` that `ring` cannot unify. `set` makes `m` opaque so

/-- **S2 helper**: lift the `Nat` `manhattan` bound to per-coordinate `Int.abs`
    bounds. Isolated from `window_cone_in_domain` below so the cone/window
    reasoning works purely in `Int`: `omega` closes the `Nat.natAbs` goals here
    in isolation, but splits the `Nat` `2^k` atom from its `(2^k : Int)` cast
    when both appear in one goal (a known `omega` limitation on mixed
    `Nat`/`Int` atoms). -/

/-- **S2** (CLOSED): the light cone does not leak out of the MacroCell domain.

    For a point `p` in the centered window `[2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1))²` (the region
    the Hashlife result covers), any cell `q` within Manhattan distance `2^k`
    of `p` — i.e. any cell in the light cone `lightCone p (2^k)` (radius `2^k`
    is exactly the cone radius of `evolve 2^(k-1)` via `step_light_cone`) —
    stays inside the full MacroCell domain `[0, 2^(k+2))²`.

    This is the geometric core of the "boundary does not leak" half of P4.4:
    it is why the wave-2 super-cells, each computing `evolve 2^(k-1)` on its
    own grid, nonetheless agree with the global `evolve 2^k` on the centered
    window — every cell that could influence a centered point is still within
    the MacroCell's recorded domain. No `hashlifeResultAux`, no whnf wall —
    pure Manhattan arithmetic over `Int`, reusing `manhattan` (L85). The proof
    bridges via `manhattan_deviation`, proves the power facts `2^(k+1) = 2·2^k`
    and `2^(k+2) = 4·2^k` in pure `Nat` (rw + `Nat.pow_succ`), rewrites them in
    so everything is linear in the single atom `2^k`, and closes with `linarith`
    (`omega` loses the positivity of `2^k` under the multiplicative atoms). -/

/-- **P4 entry point**: the pointwise membership biconditional for the
    inductive step. Glues `p4_double_nine_shape` (P4.1), `p4_wave1_ih`
    (P4.2), and `p4_wave2_ih` (P4.3). The P4.4 half-step composition is
    subsumed by the closed lemmas `evolve_add` (L2353) + `evolve_half_step`
    (L2370) and the wave-assembly residual carried in this proof body's own
    `sorry`. Once the residual closes, this function produces the
    `∀ p, p ∈ ... ↔ p ∈ ...` hypothesis that `p4_ext_bridge` consumes.

    **Pointwise-proof balisage (c.147)** — the residual `sorry` after `intro p`
    is the pointwise form of the P4.4 sub-cell coverage (S3) + assemble (S4)
    argument, decomposed here into three named pieces:
    - **G1 (geometric, tractable)** — RHS reduction: `p ∈ restrictGridTo
      (evolve 2^k g) 2^k 2^(k+1)` splits via `mem_restrictGridTo` into window
      bounds `[2^k, 3·2^k)²` (since `2^k + 2^(k+1) = 3·2^k`) plus the cell-state
      `isAlive (evolve 2^k g) p`. Pure arithmetic, no `hashlifeResultAux`.
    - **G2 (whnf-hard)** — LHS reduction: `p ∈ (hashlifeResultAux (k+2) c).toGrid
      (2^k, 2^k)` agrees, on the containing quadrant `q_j`, with `evolve 2^(k-1)`
      on `q_j.toGrid`, via the four `centralCorrect q_j (k-1)` from `_h3` (P4.3).
      Touches `hashlifeResultAux` results → the c.139/142/143 whnf wall.
    - **G3 (whnf-hard assemble)** — combine G1 and G2 with `step_light_cone`
      (locality, radius `2·2^k`) and `evolve_half_step` (the `2^k` half-step
      `evolve 2^k = evolve 2^(k-1) ∘ evolve 2^(k-1)`, now closed): the local
      sub-cell computation equals the global `evolve 2^k` on the centered window.

    Of these, `evolve_half_step` (the G3 half-step composition) is closed;
    G1/G2/G3 themselves remain `sorry` because they compose `hashlifeResultAux`
    results (the whnf-hard core, reserved for dedicated multi-cycle effort). -/

/-- For a level-`k` MacroCell `c` with `k ≥ 2`, the centered region of
    `hashlifeResultAux (k+2) c` (viewed at offset `(2^k, 2^k)`) equals
    `evolve (2^k)` applied to `c.toGrid (0, 0)` and restricted to the
    centered `[2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1)) × [2^k, 2^k + 2^(k+1))` region.

    **Statement correction**: offset `(2^k, 2^k)` accounts for centering.

    **Proof strategy** (P4, difficulty: hard, compositional):
    Strong induction on `k`.
    - Base `k = 0`: `hashlifeResultAux 2 c` reduces to `step4x4 c`, which
      is the direct B3/S23 computation on a 4x4 grid. The centered 2x2

/-! ## P5. Fuel-exhaustion invariant (Gap 1)

A definitional building block toward the full P5 theorem. The auxiliary
`evolveHashlifeFastAux` has a defensive branch `| 0, _, g => g` (fuel exhausted,
return the grid unchanged) which is only sound when `n = 0` has also been
reached. The lemma below discharges the relevant case directly: when `n = 0`,
the **first** pattern (`| _, 0, g => g`) fires regardless of the fuel value,
so the result is `g` independently of the fuel-exhaustion arm.

This is the first half of the Gap-1 invariant (the `n = 0` guard takes
priority over the fuel guard); the second half — proving the fuel-exhaustion
arm is unreachable on the real `evolveHashlifeFast n g = evolveHashlifeFastAux n n g`
call path when `n > 0` — remains open and is documented in `hashlife_correct`. -/

/-- When `n = 0`, `evolveHashlifeFastAux` returns `g` independently of the fuel
    value: the `n = 0` pattern (`| _, 0, g => g`) is matched before the

    in the trivial case and is a prerequisite for reasoning about the
    fuel-invariant behaviour of `evolveHashlifeFast`. -/

/-! ## P5 inductive step — scaffolding (fallback + jump)

The `sorry` previously sitting at the top of `hashlife_correct` is the second
research-level verrou. It is the **composition** of P4 (central correctness)
with P2 (light-cone) by induction on `n`, with a case split on the MacroCell
level `k` chosen by `box_assez_grand`.

### Proof plan (small-n fallback + large-n jump)

Given `n` and a grid `g` with `box_assez_grand g n`, let `k` be the level
chosen by the predicate (so `c = buildFromGrid k g` is a well-formed level-`k`
cell containing `g` with enough padding). Two cases:

  **Small `n`** (`n < 2^(k-2)`): `evolveHashlifeFast` falls back to `evolve`
  directly — its `evolveHashlifeFastAux` defensive branch delegates to the
  reference step-by-step implementation. Trivially equal. Difficulty: P5.1.

  **Large `n`** (`n ≥ 2^(k-2)`): one Hashlife jump of `2^(k-2)` generations by
  P4 (`hashlifeResult_central_correct`), then recurse on the residual
  `n - 2^(k-2)` generations. The light-cone lemma P2 (`step_light_cone`,
  proven) ensures the boundary of the MacroCell does not interfere with the
  live region during the jump. The padding hypothesis `box_assez_grand` is
  preserved through the recursion (the jump expands the bounding box by at
  most `2^(k-2)`, within the padding margin). Difficulty: P5.2.

### Dependency

`p5_large_n_jump` (P5.2) calls `hashlifeResult_central_correct` (P4) — so P5
is **blocked until P4's inductive step is proven**. But `p5_small_n_fallback`
(P5.1) is independent of P4 and can be proven now. The full
`p5_inductive_step` glues the two cases; it stays `sorry` until both sub-lemmas
are ready.

### Sub-lemmas (difficulty-ranked)

| Lemma | Difficulty | Dependency | What it proves |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `p5_small_n_fallback` | P5.1 (definitional) | none | When `n < 2^(k-2)`, `evolveHashlifeFast n g = evolve n g` by the defensive fallback arm |
| `p5_large_n_jump`     | P5.2 (compositional) | **P4** + P2 | When `n ≥ 2^(k-2)`, one P4 jump + light-cone-preserving recursion on `n - 2^(k-2)` |
| `p5_inductive_step`   | P5.3 (glue)         | P5.1 + P5.2 | The full induction on `n`, case-split on `n vs 2^(k-2)` |

See `agent_tests/prover/RUNBOOK.md` for the iteration protocol. -/

/-- **P5.1** (definitional, no P4 dependency): when the number of generations
    `n` is smaller than `jumpSize lvl` (the Hashlife jump size for the grid's
    MacroCell level `lvl`), `evolveHashlifeFast` does not make a recursive
    Hashlife jump — it falls back to the reference `evolve`. This is pure
    definitional unfolding of `evolveHashlifeFastAux`'s small-n arm.

    **PROVEN** (eliminates 1 sorry from the scaffolding). The `zero` case is
    definitional (`evolve 0 g = g`). The `succ k` case splits the guard
    `lvl ≥ 2 && (k+1) ≥ jumpSize lvl`: the guard-true branch contradicts the
    hypothesis `k+1 < jumpSize lvl`, the guard-false branch is the `evolve`
    fallback (definitional equality). -/

/-! ### P5.2 obstacle scan (2026-06-15)

**Status after merges #3053 + #3062.** The wf+level structural inputs feeding
`hashlifeResult_central_correct` (L1412) at the P5.2 jump step are now formally
available:

- `wf_padCenter2`    (L1028, PR #3053): `c.wf = true → (padCenter2 c).wf = true`
- `level_padCenter2` (L1031, PR #3062): `1 ≤ c.level → (padCenter2 c).level = c.level + 2`

So when `p5_large_n_jump` eventually invokes the P4 lemma on `padCenter2 c`,
both hypotheses `(hwf : (padCenter2 c).wf = true)` and
`(hk : (padCenter2 c).level = k + 2)` (with `k := c.level`) are dischargeable
from `c.wf = true` and `1 ≤ c.level`. The "wf composition lift residual"
dispatched 2026-06-15 09:59Z is now structurally closed on both axes.

**Residual obstacle chain (3 `sorry` total: L2527, L2855, L2864).**

  `p5_large_n_jump`            (L2852, re-signed to real target — proof body `sorry` at L2855)
    └→ `hashlifeResult_central_correct`  (L2546 — P4 entry point)
         └→ inductive `succ k` arm of P4 — 1 residual `sorry`:
              · wave-glue residual       (L2527, succ-arm composition + assembly)
            (the shape/IH sub-lemmas `p4_double_nine_shape` L1744, `p4_wave1_ih_step`
            L2108, `p4_wave2_ih_step` L2146 carry no `sorry`; the P4.4 half-step
            composition is closed via `evolve_add`/`evolve_half_step` — see note)

The P4 inductive step is **research-level, multi-cycle**. The base case `k = 0`
of P4 is already fully proven (`hashlifeResult_central_correct_base`, L1648,
shape lemmas + `2^16` `native_decide`).

**Note on P4.4 (SUPPRESSED in N2-bis, 2026-07-09).** The standalone
`p4_half_steps_compose` theorem was a `: True` placeholder. Its pure-evolve
half-step content is exactly `evolve_add` (L2353) + `evolve_half_step` (L2370),
both already proven sorry-free; its wave-assembly content is exactly the
wave-glue residual (L2527). Re-signing it would either duplicate L2527 or be
vacuously provable (gaming the sorry count, G.2), so the coordinator greenlit
its **deletion** (sorry 4→3) together with its unused `have _h4` consumer in
`p4_succ_membership`. P4.4 is now carried by `evolve_add`/`evolve_half_step`
(closed) + the L2527 residual.

**N1 frame sub-claim — AUDITED VACUOUS (2026-07-09).** The previously sketched
grain

  `BoxAssezGrand g n → n ≥ jumpSize ... → BoxAssezGrand (jumpResult g) (n - jumpSize ...)`

was audited before proving: its hypotheses are **jointly unsatisfiable on
non-empty grids** (`p5_large_n_hyps_unsat`, proved in the "Structural
satisfiability bound" section above — `BoxAssezGrand g n` caps `n ≤ 2` while
`jumpSize ≥ 8`). Proving it "via decidable evaluation + Nat arithmetic" would
land another vacuous placeholder (the `p4_half_steps_compose` trap, N2-bis).
The frame lemma only becomes meaningful after the `gridFrame`/`box_assez_grand`
satisfiability redesign (design gate, ai-01) — re-scope it then.

**Re-signed target (N2, 2026-07-09).** `p5_large_n_jump` (L2852) now carries the
real conclusion

  `(h : BoxAssezGrand g n) (hbig : n ≥ jumpSize (gridToMacroCellWithOffset g).2.level) →`
  `  evolveHashlifeFast n g = evolve n g`

with the proof body still `sorry` (L2855) pending the P4 unlock. The obstacle
remains structural-on-P4, not local-on-P5. -/

/-- **P5.2** (compositional, blocked on P4): when `n ≥ 2^(k-2)`,
    `evolveHashlifeFast n g` makes one Hashlife jump of `2^(k-2)` generations
    (certified equal to `evolve (2^(k-2))` by P4, `hashlifeResult_central_correct`),
    then recurses on `n - 2^(k-2)`. The light-cone lemma P2
    (`step_light_cone`, proven) guarantees the jump does not leak boundary
    cells into the live region, and `box_assez_grand` is preserved through the
    recursion. Difficulty: P5.2 (research-level; **blocked until P4
    inductive step proven**). -/

  sorry

/-- **P5.3** (glue): the full induction on `n`, with a case split on
    `n < 2^(k-2)` (P5.1) vs `n ≥ 2^(k-2)` (P5.2). Stays `sorry` until both
    sub-lemmas are proven.

    **P5 vacuity analysis (c.307a, 2026-07-10)**: on non-empty grids, the
    hypotheses of the `¬ hsmall` branch are jointly unsatisfiable — see
    `p5_large_n_hyps_unsat` (L425). Concretely:
    - `BoxAssezGrand g n` caps `n ≤ 2` (`boxAssezGrand_nonempty_le_two`,
      proven L358);
    - `n ≥ jumpSize (gridToMacroCellWithOffset g).2.level` requires
      `n ≥ 8` (`jumpSize_gridLevel_ge_eight`, proven L411).
    The conjunction `2 ≤ n ∧ n ≥ 8` is impossible. Hence the large-n arm
    is vacuous on non-empty grids, and `hashlife_correct` would be proven
    if the empty-grid arm (`g = []`) is closed separately (by direct unfold
    of `evolveHashlifeFastAux` on `g = []`, which takes the guard-false
    direct `evolve n g` arm because empty grids yield a level-0 MacroCell
    whose `lvl ≥ 2` guard is false).

    **Honest disclosure**: this vacuity closure is STRUCTURAL, not
    operational. It proves `hashlife_correct` (the bounded correctness
    theorem) WITHOUT actually exercising a Hashlife jump on non-empty
    grids — `box_assez_grand` is too tight (padding margin = 2 cells) to
    allow `n ≥ 8`. The genuine P5.2 jump-step correctness
    (`p5_large_n_jump`, L2999) remains an open sorry, gated on the P4 unlock
    per the section header at L2982. The vacuity closure demonstrates that
    `hashlife_correct`'s STATEMENT is satisfiable on canonical witness
    patterns (`hashlife_correct_implies_block_4` / `_glider_8`), but the
    theorem needs a SATISFIABILITY REDESIGN (`box_assez_grand` → a weaker
    hypothesis that allows `n ≥ 8`) before the genuine P5 jump can be
    proven. -/

/-- **Hashlife correctness (bounded)**: under the padding hypothesis
    `box_assez_grand g n`, the exponential-speedup Hashlife implementation
    `evolveHashlifeFast n g` agrees with the reference `evolve n g`.

    **Proof strategy** (P5, difficulty: hard, compositional):
    Induction on `n` with case split on the MacroCell level `k`.
    - Small `n` (n < 2^k): `evolveHashlifeFast` falls back to `evolve`,
      trivially equal.
    - Large `n` (n ≥ 2^k): one jump of `2^k` generations by P4 + recurse on
      the residual `n - 2^k`. The light-cone lemma P2 ensures the boundary
      of the MacroCell doesn't interfere with the live region during the
      jump. The padding hypothesis `box_assez_grand` is preserved through
      the recursion because the jump preserves bounding box up to light-cone
      expansion.

/-- **Consequence of the strengthen (c.151)**: the strengthened `box_assez_grand`
    only holds for `n ≤ 2` on these canonical patterns, because `gridFrame`
    fixes a 2-cell top/left padding (`r0 := rMin - 2`), so the top margin is
    exactly `2` — `r0 + n ≤ rMin` forces `n ≤ 2`. This is honest geometric
    content (the old vacuous predicate accepted `n = 4, 8` for free). It also
    surfaces a real property of the current `gridFrame`: it under-pads for
    large-`n` correctness, which is material for the P5 plan. -/

/-- The glider (3x3 bounding box) also holds for `n = 2` (its top/left margin
    is the same fixed `2` from `gridFrame`, and its bottom/right margin is
    large enough in the level-`3` frame). -/

/-- If the theorem is true, then the `native_decide` witnesses must hold.
